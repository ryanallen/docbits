# docbits

A single source of truth for documentation, keeping things [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) and maintainable.

## How it works

- Starting in your `-r` or `--root` folder, docbits will look for variables in the format `${variable_name}`.
- For each variable, it will look in your `-b` or `--bitsDirName` folder for a file with a base name matching the variable name.
  - `${foo}` will look for a file in `_bits` matching `foo*`, which could be a file named `foo.md` or `foo.yml` or just `foo`.
- Once found, the variable will be replaced by the exact file contents of the bit.
- Finally, the resulting documentation will be written at `-o` or `--outputDir`, preserving the existing folder structure.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev docbits
